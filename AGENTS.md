# Agent Instructions

Before starting work, read `ROADMAP.md` for product direction and `TASKS.md` for current claims, dependencies, and acceptance criteria.

## Coordination and worktrees

- Use a separate Git worktree and branch for each agent/task. Do not edit the shared primary checkout when other agents or the user may be working in it.
- Start from the latest `main`. Use a task-specific branch such as `agent/P-006-virtual-folder-criteria` and a task-specific worktree outside the primary checkout.
- Claim one **Unclaimed** task in `TASKS.md` before editing. Record the owner, branch, and worktree in the task row; change its status to **In progress**. Do not start a task already marked In progress or Review.
- If the required worktree cannot be created, stop before editing and tell the coordinator what is blocking it. Do not fall back to editing another agent's checkout.
- Keep one task per branch. Avoid overlapping files with other active tasks; coordinate sequencing when overlap is unavoidable.
- Do not reset, overwrite, stage, or commit another agent's changes. Inspect the worktree status before editing and before committing.
- When implementation is ready, run only the checks appropriate to the task and project instructions, commit on the task branch, and update `TASKS.md` with the commit and review status. Do not merge or push another agent's branch; integration belongs to the coordinator.
- Update `ROADMAP.md` only when scope, priority, or a durable product decision changes. Keep `TASKS.md` as the execution/claim ledger.

## Project guidance

- Preserve mail data. A cross-account move must confirm the destination copy before deleting the source.
- Keep routine sync lightweight: fetch headers and flags during sync; fetch full message content when requested by the user.
- Read `CONTRIBUTING.md` for project conventions. Keep changes focused and describe verification and known limitations in the task update.
